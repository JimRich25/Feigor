## Welcome to Feigor Adventurer

1296 years ago, in an effort to protect the people, the warrior races of the planet Headenhelm 
were commissioned with herding the most vicious beasts to the southern end of the planet while the
elven mages prepared to isolate the threats using a Prison Crystal.  When dropped into the core of the 
planet, this magic gem would permanently separate the beasts from the civilized people of the world. 
Unfortunately, things did not go as planned.  When the crystal entered the core there was a massive 
explosion of magic in the form of a disc along the equator that destroyed most of the planet, leaving two 
floating continents at the north and south poles.  The continent at the north pole thrived with people 
adept in magical arts and because of the peaceful energy that they exuded, it became an unchanging 
paradise full of life and was named Feigor (fay-gore) after the Goddess of Peace and Light.  However, the 
continent at the south pole trapped the warrior races amongst the beasts and became a barren
wasteland run by survival of the strong.  The unforgiving land was named Ombdor (om-door) after the
God of War and Darkness.  This pivotal moment in history was the beginning of a new era and thus every 
year after was counted anew and known as the time “after the splitting,” or ATP.
